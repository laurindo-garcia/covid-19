    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed overfitting in the context of bias and variance, and we've touched on some techniques that are used to avoid overfitting (but haven't practiced them yet). In this project, we'll practice a fundamental method for avoiding overfitting that is commonly referred to as: _train/test split validation_. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to something called \"cross-validation\" — in fact, it is a type of cross-validation — in that we will be splitting the data into two subsets:\n",
    "* A subset on which to train our model.\n",
    "* A subset on which to test our model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves two useful purposes:\n",
    "* We prevent overfitting by not using all of the data.\n",
    "* We have some remaining data we can use to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may seem like a relatively simple idea, **there are some caveats** to putting it into practice. For example, if you are not careful, it is easy to take a non-random split. Suppose we have salary data on technical professionals that is composed of 80 percent data from California, 20 percent data from elsewhere, and is sorted by state. If we split our data into 80 percent training data and 20 percent testing data, we might inadvertantly select all the California data to train and all the non-California data to test. In this case, we've still overfit on our data set because we did not sufficiently randomize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In a situation like this, you could use a technique called _k-fold cross-validation_, which is cross-validation applied to more than two subsets. In particular, in k-fold cross-validation, you'd partition your data into $k$ subsets and train on $k-1$ one of them, holding the last slice for testing. You would do this for each of the possible $k-1$ subsets."
